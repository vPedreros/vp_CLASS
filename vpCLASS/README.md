# vp_CLASS
The main idea is to merge hi_class with CO$N$CEPT's version of CLASS.

This code can be compiled. 

To-dos:
1. Verify that power spectra is the expected
2. See if the same happens when calling CLASS from CO$N$CEPT
3. Implement a way to give the Horndeski Lagrangian to CLASS from CO$N$CEPT
